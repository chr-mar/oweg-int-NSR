# Offshore Wind Energy Potentials in the North Sea Region

A place to store data and code for my Master's thesis Offshore Wind Energy Potentials in the North Sea Region.

The main script is oweg.ipynb. Several other scripts need to be run before in order to create shapefiles, that are a prerequisite for oweg.ipynb.
These data processing scripts themselves make use of unedited shapefiles from external sources. These can be quite large, too large for GitHub.
A link at the top of the script indicates where the data can be downloaded. 
The designated folder for these files is the "data" folder.

Copying the folder structure onto the local machine and saving the required input shapefiles allows the execution.
Folder paths in the scripts are relative and should work.

All scripts except for oweg.ipynb are uploaded with the output displayed in the notebook. 


Hywind_wind_speed_comparison needs the .xlsx-file Hywind_Wind_Speeds.
